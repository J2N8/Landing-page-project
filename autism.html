    </h3>

    <p>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a ‚Äúdevelopmental disorder‚Äù because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.
